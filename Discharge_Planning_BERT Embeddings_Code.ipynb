As we \\ndiscussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to \\nmake them urinate and it\\'s likely that you weren\\'t taking a high \\nenough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess \\nfluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. \\n___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy \\nand EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. \\nWe wish you all the best!\\nYour ___ Team.  \\n \\nFollowup Instructions:\\n___\\n'"

It is normal to feel tired or \"washed out\" after surgery, and this feeling should improve over the first few days to week. - Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times. ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING: - Weightbearing as tolerated left lower extremity MEDICATIONS: 1) Take Tylenol every 6 hours around the clock. This is an over the counter medication. 2) Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean off this medication in 1 week or sooner. This is an example on how to wean down: Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day. Then continue with Tylenol for pain. 3) Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic medication. 4) Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot refill this type of pain medication over the phone. 5) Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy. 6) Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers. 7) Please take all medications as prescribed by your physicians at discharge. 8) Continue all home medications unless specifically instructed to stop by your surgeon. ANTICOAGULATION: - Please take Lovenox daily for 4 weeks</td>\n",

It is normal to feel tired or \"washed out\" after surgery, and this feeling should improve over the first few days to week. - Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times. ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING: - Weightbearing as tolerated left lower extremity MEDICATIONS: 1) Take Tylenol every 6 hours around the clock. This is an over the counter medication. 2) Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean off this medication in 1 week or sooner. This is an example on how to wean down: Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day. Then continue with Tylenol for pain. 3) Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic medication. 4) Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot refill this type of pain medication over the phone. 5) Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy. 6) Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers. 7) Please take all medications as prescribed by your physicians at discharge. 8) Continue all home medications unless specifically instructed to stop by your surgeon. ANTICOAGULATION: - Please take Lovenox daily for 4 weeks\n",
